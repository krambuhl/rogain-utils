## createFrame(tree, locals)

Creates a tree node of the `frame` type with `locals` as scope data and `tree` as children.  This represents a new scope, no variables fall through by default â€“ all locals should be manually defined from outside scopes.

```js
var frame = createFrame(tree, locals);
// { type: 'frame', children: tree, locals: locals }
```

## splitTrees(treeList, match)

Splits an array of trees at matching tree.

___treeList___

Array of trees.

___match___

Object.

`match` is used to segment the input array between each matching tree.

```js
var branches = splitTree(tree.children, {
    type: 'component',
    name: 'Else'
});

var passing = branches[0];
var failing = branches[1];
```

__note__ will return an array of tree branches in the format `[ [ trees ], [ trees ] ]` even on a single tree result like, `[ [ tree ] ]`


## find(treeList, match)

Finds the first tree matching the `match` object in `treeList`.

___treeList___

Array of trees.  Haystack of trees.

___match___

Object. Needle tree.

```js

```


## findAll(treeList, match)

___treeList___

Array of trees.  Haystack of trees.

___match___

Object. Needle tree.

```js
var res = findAll(tree.children, { type: 'tag', tagName: 'a' });

## findPath(tree, match, initialPath)
